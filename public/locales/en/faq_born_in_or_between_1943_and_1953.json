    "faq-answer-1": [
        "Pension earnings for care work is not extra pay that you receive from the National Insurance Scheme, rather it is a scheme to ensure you get a higher pension when you start drawing a pension. You must be a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme during the period of care in order to be entitled to pension earnings for care work.",
        "The pension earnings for care work scheme was introduced in 1992. You will not normally receive pension earnings for care work for years prior to this."
